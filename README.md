## Background & Vision

Ratnadeep personally likes to share conference talk videos with other devs as reference material. Especially when itâ€™s good for the exact same thing that another person is trying to learn. There are many long lived talks - like ones talking about good object oriented programming with Ruby. Then there are also some which are good to keep up with upcoming tech - like keynotes that talk about upcoming Ruby or Rails versions.  

The way to discover these talks is either by recommendations by someone or finding one by serendipity. This website will solve this problem of discovery of tech talks for users.
